With the changes in regulations for the GT1 category, the 1997 McLaren F1 GTR gained it's ubiquitous 'Longtail' amongst various other modifications in order to ward off the new competition in the form of Porsche's 911 GT1 and Mercedes-Benz's CLK GTR with great success in the FIA GT Championship. It stayed in competition until 2005 in the Japanese SUPER GT series.
