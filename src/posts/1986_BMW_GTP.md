Based off of a modified March 86G chassis, the BMW GTP was the Bavarian manufacturer's entrant into the IMSA GTP class of the 1980s. It utilized a BMW M12/14 that soon became its Achilles' heel through its lack of reliability. It garnered a sole victory at Watkins Glen in 1986 and was axed from competition by the end of the season.
