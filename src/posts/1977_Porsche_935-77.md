The Porsche 935 debuted in 1976 for competition in the popular Group 5 category and underwent a series of evolutions from both the Stuttgart factory and various privateers. The car was hugely popular and found success in a handful of prestigious events such as the Sebring 12 Hours, Le Mans 24, Daytona 24 and the NÃ¼rburgring 1000km.
