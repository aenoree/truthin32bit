The MC12 GT1 was Maserati's entry into the top class of grand touring competition, debuting in the FIA GT Championship in 2004 halfway through the season. In 2005 it returned with a revised front end and rear spoiler. Vitaphone Racing Team found great success with the MC12 tallying up 5 FIA GT1 Teams' titles and 3 overall victories in the Spa 24 Hours.
