The Porsche 911 GT1-98, although not as quick as its contemporaries, famously achieved a 1-2 result at the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans. As the rest of the field suffered multiple mechanical failures, the reliability of the all-new 911 GT1-98 allowed it to triumph over the ailing Mercedes-Benz CLK LMs, Toyota GT-ones and BMW V12 LMs.
