Bentley broke the winning streak of Audi in 2003 with their Speed 8, as the brand achieved it's first victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans since 1930. The car shared almost nothing, save for the engine, from the previous EXP Speed 8 that competed previously in 2001 and 2002. The #8 car featured shorter endplates than the winning #7's nearly enclosed endplates.
