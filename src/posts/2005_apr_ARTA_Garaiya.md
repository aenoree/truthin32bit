Developed by Japanese constructor apr to replace the out-going Toyota MR-S GT300, the Garaiya was based off of Autobacs Sportscar Laboratory's road-going variant that unfortunately was cancelled for production. In 2004 and 2005, it was powered by the six-cylinder Nissan VQ35DE. Autobacks Racing Team Aguri came short multiple times of the GT300 title with the Garaiya.
