Audi dominated Le Mans throughout the first half of the 2000s with their R8 prototype, achieving a famous hat-trick of victories after the 2002 edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The car won again in 2004 and 2005 and competed until 2006 where it finally retired after achieving its final victory at Lime Rock in the American Le Mans Series.
