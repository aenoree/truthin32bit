The Nissan R390 was a Group GT1 car first raced in 1997. After issues with gearbox cooling, the car was revised in 1998 with a longer rear end to also satisfy the 'luggage capacity' demands set by the ACO and a new rear wing. The #30 car in 1998 was driven by John Nielsen, Michael Krumm and Franck Lagorce and finished 5th. The highest finishing R390 that year, the #32, finished 3rd.
