In 2018 the heavily revised NSX-GT saw Honda take it's first GT500 driver's title since 2010 with Naoki Yamamoto and 2009 F1 World Drivers' Champion Jenson Button behind the wheel of the No. 100 Team Kunimitsu NSX-GT. It was also Team Kunimitsu's first ever title in the series since it's entrance into the series in 1996, headed by former driver and rider Kunimitsu Takahashi.
