The Audi A4 was the German marque's entrant into the DTM series starting in 2004 after the series phased out two-door coupe bodies for four-door sedan bodies. Mattias Ekstr√∂m won that year's championship for Audi in the new A4 for Abt Sportsline. Displayed is Pierre Kaffer driving the R9 chassis in 2005 for Team Joest, whilst Abt Sportsline used the new R11 chassis.
