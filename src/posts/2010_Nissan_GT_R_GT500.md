The GT-R was introduced in place of the Fairlady Z in 2008 to coincide with the global release of the R35 GT-R. It immediately took the title that year with Satoshi Motoyama and Benoît Tréluyer behind the wheel. In 2010 the duo racing for Nismo finished 7th in the drivers' standings with two 2nd place finishes, with the highest placing Nissan being TEAM IMPUL in 5th.
