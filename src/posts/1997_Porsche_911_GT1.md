Porsche developed a radical GT1 machine in 1996 based off of the 911 -- though the car didn't have much in common with its road-going relative. In 1997, Porsche revised the car with styling cues from the 996 generation along with aerodynamic changes that improved the car's performance, but would fall short of glory at that year's 24 Hours of Le Mans.
