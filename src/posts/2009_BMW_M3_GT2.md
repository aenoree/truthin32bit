The 2009 BMW M3 GT2 was the German brand's return to the American Le Mans Series after the famous BMW M3 GTR in 2001. Most known for featuring on the cover of racing video game Need For Speed: Shift, the car took its first win at Road America with Bill Auberlen and Joey Hand behind the wheel after suffering mechanical issues early on in the season.
