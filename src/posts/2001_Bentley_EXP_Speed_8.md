Taking shape from the Norfolk-based Audi R8R program in 1999, Bentley made a return to Le Mans after over 73 years with the EXP Speed 8. The #8 car driven by Andy Wallace, Butch Leitzinger and Eric van de Poele finished in 3rd at the 2001 24 Hours of Le Mans. The car reappeared in the 2002 edition before being succeeded by the Speed 8 in 2003.
