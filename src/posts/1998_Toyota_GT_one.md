The 1998 Toyota GT-one (TS020) is a Group GT1 car made in 1998 to contest the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It infamously exploited a loophole in the regulations which allowed it to compete in the class due to TTE citing the fuel tank size as a suitable luggage space when empty. Whilst all three cars were touted as favorites in the 1998 24 Hours, only the #27 driven by Ukyo Katayama, Toshio Suzuki and 'Drift King' Keiichi Tsuchiya managed to finish the race in 9th.
