Manabu Orido and Tatsuya Kataoka brought this unique apr constructed mid-engined Lexus to a SUPER GT GT300 title in 2009. It featured an engine from Toyota's Formula Nippon (Now SUPER FORMULA) car and shared little relation to the road going IS350 -- save for parts of the greenhouse, the grille, headlights and badges. This would be formula apr followed for years to come.
