The NSX-GT Concept was a GT500 racing car that debuted with the new GT500 regulations that were in line with Class 1, meant for a future collaboration between Super GT and DTM. Despite the regulations mandating cars to be front engined, Honda managed to produce the car with a mid-engine layout as well as making use of a hybrid system.
