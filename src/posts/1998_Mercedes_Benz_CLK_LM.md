The Mercedes-Benz CLK LM is an evolution of the 1997 CLK GTR (which many often confuse with being associated with this car!) that debuted in the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans. It was powered by a non-turbocharged variant of the engine found in the Sauber C9 dubbed the GT 108B. The #35 car driven by Bernd Schneider topped the timing charts after qualifying, but neither of the three entrants from AMG-Mercedes managed to make the full 24 Hours.
